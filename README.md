# BASICSHELL-v4.0-Chinese-Simplified-Edition
BASICSHELL is a shell written in Python

Original name: homemade shell

BASICSHELL supports Multi-user, file management Although there is a disadvantage: the information cannot be saved

However, this is my favorite Python work

The updated content is as follows:
-BSUI
  BSUI is a small component of BASICHSELL
  Users can interact with BASICSHELL through BSUI without entering commands
  Of course, if you are accustomed to using the command line, you can also exit BSUI or enter the terminal through BSUI
  BSUI can self start and will start when entering BASICSHELL. If you want to permanently close BSUI, please modify the value of tobsui in the code to False
